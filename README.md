# Matasano Challenges

This is my resolution to the [cryptopals challenges](https://cryptopals.com/). The main idea of this project is to learn the legacy cryptographic protocols and their vulnerabilities. Currently, all the challenges were solved in python and without much structure, but the goal is to later refactor them into another language and with better quality code.
